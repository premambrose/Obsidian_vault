**ai**: ### Summary of Key Activities and Goals for 2023 and 2024

#### Technical Activities (2023)

1. **Maze Game 3.0 Development**
   - **Motor Control System**: Developed a motor control system using PID control to stabilize the ball in position.
   - **Dynamic Walls Detection**: Implemented an application that detects dynamic walls and reroutes gameplay accordingly.
   - **Multi-step Inference**: Created a multi-step inference mechanism to reduce latency and improve smooth gameplay.
   - **Feasibility Analysis**: Conducted a feasibility analysis for playing the game without physical walls, using an LCD panel to display the maze layout.

2. **Door Knock Application**
   - **Data Collection**: Collected and annotated door knock data from multiple doors.
   - **Neural Network Development**: Developed a neural network suitable for ISPU to detect patterns in door knocks.
   - **Documentation**: Prepared detailed reports on dataset collection, architecture, and preprocessing methods.

3. **Technical Research on AI**
   - **Patent Proposals**: Prepared patent proposals for the "Door knock application."
   - **Paper Publication**: Wrote a paper for submission to a conference/journal.
   - **N6 Acceleration NPU Study**: Investigated using N6 acceleration NPU for data preprocessing.

#### Personal Development (2023)

1. **Language Learning**
   - Completed the A1 Italian course and prepared a technical presentation in Italian about Maze Game v3.

2. **Technical Courses**
   - Completed two technical courses from online platforms like Coursera.

3. **Reading and Summarizing**
