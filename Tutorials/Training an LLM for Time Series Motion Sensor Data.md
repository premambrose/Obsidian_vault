## Key Considerations

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**

| Step | Description | Importance |
|------|-------------|------------|
| Normalization/Standardization | Scale data to handle varying ranges in sensor readings. | High |
| Handling Missing Data | Use interpolation or imputation to fill gaps. | Medium |
| Data Augmentation | Apply noise addition or temporal shifting to enhance robustness. | High |

### 2. **Model Adaptation**

- **Attention Mechanisms:** Utilize self-attention to capture temporal dependencies.
- **Transformer Architectures:** Consider using architectures like Time Series Transformers for sequential data handling.

### 3. **Evaluation Metrics**

| Metric | Description | Use Case |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| MAE (Mean Absolute Error) | Measures average prediction error. | Regression tasks |
| RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) | Provides a higher weight to larger errors. | Regression tasks |

### 4. **Challenges**

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| Data Sparsity | Use data augmentation or transfer learning. |
| Interpretability | Implement attention visualization techniques. |

### 2. **Sequential Processing**

| Model Type | Description | Strengths |
|------------|-------------|-----------|
| Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) | Process sequences step-by-step. | Handles sequential data. |
| Transformers | Use attention mechanisms for long-range dependencies. | Better performance on long sequences. |
