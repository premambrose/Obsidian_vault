- De reference pointer in loop is costly
- Register variable as counter for loop 
	- eg : register int i;
- Avoid floating operations
- Break math operations into smaller single operations in a line 
- Recommended usage of unsigned values
- Avoid use of "else"
- Replace 'switch' with 'if' conditions
- 1 dimensional arrays recommended
- Minimal operations inside the loop recommended
- Bit wise operations suggested
	- a<<1: Mul 
	- a>>1: Div
- Break switch to nested switch for common cases
- Place frequently happening case as first case in Switch condition
- A || B, A && B
- Place the likely case to happen first when defining multiple condition statements
	- eg : for (a != 1, b!=0, c!=0)
		- a!=1 more likely to happen, placed first
- **Left shift**
	- variable << n 
	- variable = variable * 2^n
- **Right shift**
	- variable >> n 
	- variable = variable / 2^n
