- # STM32H7471 - Disco
	- ##### Connected to the [Camera](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/b-cams-omv.html) and calculates the position of the ball in the maze in terms of pixel position. 
	- ##### Camera
		- 5 MP
		- 8bit colors
	- ##### Sends the position of the Ball in the maze to the STM-MP1 board with SPI communication
	- ##### No communication from MP1. One way
	- ##### Two operating modes
	- #### Training Mode
		 - Trains the color of the ball in three different available colors
			 - Red
			 - Blue
			 - Green
		- Ball should fill the training box with proper illumination
	- #### Tracking Mode
		- Tracks the trained ball in the image with a color mask filter
		- Gives the X, Y , Radius of the Ball in terms of Pixel
- ## STM-MP1
	- ##### Linux 
	- ##### Collects the data about the ball and takes action
	- ##### Each position of the ball in the maze holds a command to follow, which is guided by this board.
